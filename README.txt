Repository for Demography Building as graphical objects.

Demographies are encoded as directed acyclic graphs using networkx,
which can then be passed to various simulation engines to simulate
or integrate over.

There are a number of examples in the tutorial.


Need before moving on to msprime/moments implementation:
setup.py
__init__.py in demography
tests for graph structure finished
